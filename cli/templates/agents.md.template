# Windsurf Project Instructions (Global)

> These instructions apply to the ENTIRE workspace.

## 🚀 Core Principles
- Follow **SOLID** principles strictly.
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) & **KISS** (Keep It Simple).
- **No `any`** in TypeScript.

## 🛠 Available Skills
Windsurf Cascade can perform complex tasks using these skills (Auto-invoked or via `@`):

- `@project-standards` - Core conventions (Use always)
- `@backend-nestjs` - For NestJS tasks
- `@frontend-nextjs` - For Next.js tasks
- `@role-architect` - For system design
- `@role-reviewer` - For code review

## 📂 Directory-Scoped Rules
Windsurf automatically looks for `AGENTS.md` in subdirectories.
- If you are working in `/src/backend`, create an `AGENTS.md` there with specific backend rules.
- If you are working in `/src/frontend`, create an `AGENTS.md` there.

## 🤖 Role Modes
To switch modes, tell Cascade:
- "Act as Architect" -> triggers `@role-architect`
- "Review this code" -> triggers `@role-reviewer`
- "Fix this bug" -> triggers `@role-debugger`
